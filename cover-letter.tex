To Whom it May Concern, 
\vspace{1em}

\noindent
There's nothing I like more than to design computer systems, build layers of abstraction, and refactor tangled code to make it sparse and lean. I find helping the code base shrink, bugs disappear, and unit tests go from red to green uniquely satisfying. Software development, which began as a purely academic pursuit, has grown into a source of value, satisfaction, and joy.

\noindent
Cogo Labs would give me a perfect opportunity to practice these skills, and I seem quite qualified to the position. As your form says, I am a junior currently studying to get a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. While working remotely over last summer with Open Learning Exchanged, I practiced self motivation and discipline to keep working despite the distance. Later in the year I traveled to Boston to pitch the our application to at an entrepreneurial conference, gaining an affinity for a flexible and entrepreneurial work environment. While studying computer science at Brown University I have approached many challenging technical projects, working in languages including Python, Golang, C, and JavaScript--for example, I implemented Transfer Control Protocol (TCP), in which I dealt with numerous technical challenges involving concurrency, reliable transfer, and performance. I have also learned to parse and manipulate data through implementing neural networks such as my Generative Adversarial Neural-Net, which generates uncannily accurate human faces based on a massive dataset. I have worked effectively in small teams, both at Open Learning Exchange, in Coding challenges, and at Brown, helping to label and coordinate important tasks and bug fixes. In my time at Brown I have also implemented and used databases, and would be enthusiastic at the opportunity to improve my ability with SQL. I would love to work with Cogo to analyze data and create value.

I hope you will consider me for this position. Attached is my resume---feel free to reach out to me at my school email, gus\_cantieni@brown.edu, or my personal phone, 413-522-4103.
